= FlexMock 0.4.2 Released

FlexMock is a flexible mocking library for use in Ruby's Test::Unit
test framework.  Version 0.4.0 enhances FlexMock with the ability to
stub and mock methods in existing objects.

== New in 0.4.2

Release 0.4.2 contains a fix for multiple definitions of a class
method stub so that the correct original definition is retained.

== What is FlexMock?

FlexMock is a flexible Ruby mocking library that works with Ruby's
Test::Unit framework to create easy to use mocks.

=== Features

* Easy integration with Test::Unit.  Mocks created with the flexmock
  method are automatically verified at the end of the test.

* A fluent interface that allows mock behavior to be specified very
  easily.

* A "record mode" where an existing implementation can record its
  interaction with a mock for later validation against a new
  implementation.

* Easy mocking of individual methods in existing, non-mock objects.

=== Example

Suppose you had a Dog object that wagged a tail when it was happy.
Something like this:

  class Dog
    def initialize(a_tail)
      @tail = a_tail
    end
    def happy
      @tail.wag
    end
  end

To test the +Dog+ class without a real +Tail+ object (perhaps because
real +Tail+ objects activate servos in some robotic equipment), you
can do something like this:

require 'test/unit'
require 'flexmock'

  class TestDog < Test::Unit::TestCase
    include FlexMock::TestCase

    def test_dog_wags_tail_when_happy
      tail = flexmock("tail")
      tail.should_receive(:wag).once
      dog = Dog.new(tail)
      dog.happy
    end
  end

FlexMock will automatically verify that the mocked tail object
received the message +wag+ exactly one time.  If it doesn't, the test
will not pass.

See the FlexMock documentation at
http://onestepback.org/software/flexmock for details on specifying
arguments and return values on mocked methods, as well as a simple
technique for mocking tail objects when the Dog class creates the tail
objects directly.

== Availability

FlexMock is distributed with Rails, or you can make sure you have the
latest version with a quick RubyGems command:

  gem install flexmock    (you may need root/admin privileges)

Otherwise, you can get it from the more traditional places:

Download::  http://rubyforge.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=170
