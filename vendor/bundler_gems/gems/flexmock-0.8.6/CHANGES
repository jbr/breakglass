= Changes for FlexMock

== Version 0.8.5

* Fixed warning about a void context.
* hsh() argument matcher now reports its matching constraints in error
  messages.

== Version 0.8.4

* Added support for rails 2.2.x in should_render_view.

== Version 0.8.3

* Fixed a bug where the by_default option was not completely honored
  in some edge cases.

== Version 0.8.2

* Added workaround for compatibility issues with RSpec on Rails.

== Version 0.8.1

* Additional fix for Rails 2.0.2
* Added Joe O'Brien's patch to allow view stubbing in Rails 2.0
* Added Evan Phoenix's patch to remove allocate from default
  allocators in new_instances (for Rubinius compatibility).

== Version 0.8.0

* Added by_default
* Added undefined behavior
* Mock methods are added to partial mocks only if they are not
  previously defined.  This should reduce the need for safe mode.
* respond_to? on mocks now accepts multiple arguments.  This eases
  mocking in rails a little bit.
* Added experimental view mocking for rails.

== Version 0.7.2

* Changed initial model Id to 10000.
* Added test suggested for RSpec Mocks, just to make sure we were good too.

== Version 0.7.1

* Updated install.rb to handle non-root destination directories via
  DESTDIR.
* Fixed operator bug introduced in 0.7.0. 

== Version 0.7.0

* Added +and_yield+ as an expectation clause.
* Inspect on Mocks now yield a more consise description.
* Global ordering across all mocks in a container is now allowed.
* Added support for Demeter chain mocking.
* Deprecated a number of mock_* methods.

== Version 0.6.4

* Renamed flexmodel(...) to flexmock(:model, ...) because visually
  they were too similar.

== Version 0.6.3

* Added flexmodel() for better support of mocking ActiveRecord models.

* Fixed comment for singleton?

* Fixed coverage report for the partial mocking class.

* Fixed bug when partial mock objects reported they respond to a
  method but they actually didn't.

* The flexmock() method now _always_ returns a combination domain/mock
  object.  For partial mocks, this implies that the domain object now
  has mock support methods on it (e.g. should_receive).

* Safe mode for partials was introduced for the small number of cases
  where mock support methods in the domain object would cause
  problems.

* Internally renamed PartialMock to PartialMockProxy.  
	
== Version 0.6.2

* flexmock() with a block now always returns the domain object.
  flexmock() without a block returns the mock object.  Note that for
  normal mocks, the domain and mock objects are the same.  For partial
  mocks, the mock is separate from the domain object.
* Added +and_raise+ to the list of expection specifications.	

== Version 0.6.1

* Fixed bug that prevented mocks from mocking field assignment operators.
* Fixed bug that prevented partial mocks from being ordered.

== Version 0.6.0

* Dropped class interception.
* Refactored into more granular classes.
* Added RSpec integration.
* Added hash expectations to flexmock() and should_expect().
* Integrated partial mocks into the flexmock() methods.
* Allow non-block configuration of new_instances.

== Version 0.5.1

* Changed the name of any_instance to new_instances.  
  Deprecated any_instance.
* Added ability to stub any class method in new_instances.
* Added RCov task
* Reworked original behavior hooks to use method aliasing rather than method
  procs.
* Fixed bug in stubbing File class methods.

== Version 0.5.0

* Added any_instance stubbing to class objects.

== Version 0.4.5

* Fixed version typo in 0.4.4 (internally claimed to be 0.4.3.1)

* Added block support to flexstub.

== Version 0.4.3

* Fixed bug where non-direct class methods were not properly handled.
	
== Version 0.4.2

* Fixed bug where multiple stubs of a class method were not
  properly restored.
	
== Version 0.4.1

* Removed include of Test::Unit::Assertions from Expectations.
* Fixed mocking of kernel methods.

== Version 0.4.0

* Added stubbing for mocking methods of existing objects.
* Added multiple return values for the +and_returns+ method.
* Added block initialization to the flexmock method.

== Version 0.3.2

* Fixed bug when mock is used as a replacement class in class
  interception.

== Version 0.3.1

* Fixed some warnings regarding uninitialized variables.
* Added (very) simple class interception.
* Added the mock_factory method to go along with class interception.
* When using Test::Unit integration, avoid mock verification if the
  test has already failed for some reason.

* Added Test::Unit integration.

== Version 0.2.1

* Added strict mode in record mode interface to facility using known
  good algorithms for comparison testing.

  README. 
	
== Version 0.2.0

* Added record mode for building expectations.
* Fixed a bunch of documentation.

== Version 0.1.7

* Fixed the overzealous argument matching when String is given as an
  argument qualifier to +should_receive+.

== Version 0.1.4

* Added eq and any methods for argument matching.
* Added tests for the "first match" argument matching policy.

== Version 0.1.3

  instead of explicit order numbers.  This make the code easier to
  write and the API easier to understand.

* Fixed homepage in gem spec.
* Removed autorequire from gemspec.
* Fixed README to be automatically updated with FlexMock Version

== Version 0.1.1
