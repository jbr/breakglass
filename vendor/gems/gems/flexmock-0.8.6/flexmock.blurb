    <p>FlexMock is the outcome of a frustrating evening of trying to
    use the original mock object by Nat Pryce.  Nat's mock object is
    really cool, but it assumes that we know the exact calling order
    of all the methods to the mock object.  I really feel that
    over-constrains the solution code.  This little quicky seems to
    meet my needs fairly well.</p>
